    <h1>The Hackers' Collective</h1>
    <h2>We’re teaching a mindset.</h2>
    <p><img class="img-embed" src="img/kimberly-farmer-unsplash-cropped.jpg">With Hack we’re committed to cultivating digital literacy to empower the next generation with creative problem-solving skills that can be universally applied. Success for us includes more than just equipping kids with some key skills. Rather, we aim to provide a dynamic foundation for the next generation of thinkers. As kids progress through Hack, they cultivate their curiosity about how the world works.</p>

    <h2>Hacking for good</h2>
    <p><img class="img-embed" src="img/markus-spiske-unsplash-cropped.jpg">Rigged elections and cybersecurity breaches are what we often associate with the term ‘hack’, however, the concept has a long history of doing good in the world. We’ve embraced this powerful and controversial term because its genesis in creative problem-solving and empowerment over technology is precisely what we hope to nurture.</p>

    <h2>The whole world, empowered</h2>
    <p><img class="img-embed" src="img/thomas-kelley-unsplash-cropped.jpg">Hack is powered by Endless, a company founded in 2010 with the mission of enabling people to harness the power of computing. We created the Endless Operating System - a free and robust computing solution - so people everywhere have access to relevant information and technology even without an internet connection. The Endless OS is now on more than 3 million computers in 60 countries worldwide.</p>
