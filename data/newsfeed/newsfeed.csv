2020-11-09,Endless,hack-release.jpg,,"Greetings, Hackers and fans. Today, we've got another exciting update for Hack on the Desktop!

<b>Hack mode</b>
We heard you! Following up on feedback we received in several channels, we removed the concept of a Hack mode from our first class learning environment. In Hack mode, the user had the hacking affordances available, namely the <i>Flip to Hack</i> functionality to look behind an application, see what is happening behind the scenes, modify the application and run it in a sandbox environment. 

To provide the user with a sense when those affordances were available, the desktop background wallpaper changed and the cursor switched to the Hack cursor. Those changes have been perceived as intrusive (“<i>it spoils the system and it changes your cursor style</i>”). We decided to reduce that barrier of adoption and removed changing the cursor and wallpaper. The hacking affordances are available by default and not tied to a specific mode, so you can still enjoy the Sidetrack quests and use the Hacking Toolbox on the flip side of the app to solve the riddles. The pinned desktop icon, which previously had an on/off state, is now reduced to a single-state icon.

<b>Open sourcing</b>
We are very happy to announce that Hack is now fully open source. All of the components have been released under an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_license"">open source license</a>. The are available on <a href=""https://github.com"">GitHub</a>.

<b>Other Improvements and Changes</b>

<b>Visual representation of chained quests</b> We have recently introduced the concept of chained quests - such as the Sidetrack quest series. For example, in order to play Sidetrack #2,  you must first complete Sidetrack #1, and so on.

Previously, unavailable quests were hidden - Sidetrack #2 was not visible when Sidetrack #1 was incomplete. We have changed this, and now display all available quests. However, locked quests are grayed out and can not be flipped. Hovering over the grayed-out card will show a tooltip explaining the requirements to unlock that quest.

We hope this will more accurately represent the available content. We're always refining the Hack UI, though, and we welcome your suggestions and feedback. Let us know in the forum or  at #madetohack on social media!

<b>Visual representation of narrative quests</b> It might be a surprise to some of our users that we have two major types of quests available in the Clubhouse - First are the activities that help your learn and create, but there's also a second type, narrative quests. Narrative quests drive the story of the world of Hack and its characters, and tell how you, the player, fit in!

Our users and playtesters have given us the feedback that it's difficult to tell the difference, and that's important - when you want an activity, we don't want to force you to sit through a story! 

Hovering over the cards for narrative quests will now display a ""book"" icon, to help identify them.

<b>Canceling of quests</b> Quests can be canceled by clicking the 'x' icon of the dialogue. For narrative quests, that button wasn't available, so there was no correct way to cancel them, which wasn't ideal. With this change, the play button for all running quests will turn into a cancel button, allowing you to cancel any quest.

<b>New instructors/mentors</b> We are very happy to have grown the guild of Hack mentors! We've added 2 new instructor avatars, cousins of your friend the Daemon, from other systems! Look for them in current and upcoming quests... especially in this month's Krita quests!"

2019-12-17,Faber,,,@Saniel any time! hope the subject is something I can help with
2019-12-17,Saniel,,,@Faber I hope so. The subject is… personal in nature.

2019-12-17,Saniel,,,"@Faber Well, she’s a very… formidable woman. Quite intelligent. Very driven. She has a mischievous streak, definitely. I was thinking that she might appreciate a bound edition of the last 5 issues of The Journal Of Computational Linguistics – very handy."

2019-12-17,Saniel,,,@Faber What? How could that be so terrible? It’s a massively important journal for the field!
2019-12-17,Faber,,,"@Saniel totally, I know it is, but that present is from your outside. that’s the Saniel you show everyone. gifts should be from your heart, from the part you don’t show most people, that’s what makes them special!"
2019-12-17,Saniel,,,"@Faber I… don’t quite see, but I think I get what you’re driving at. The gift should be… unexpected?"
2019-12-17,Faber,,,"@Saniel sort of, yeah, like in a way that shows you’re really paying attention to that person and what they like."
2019-12-17,Saniel,,,@Faber Hm. Then perhaps… Yes. I have an idea.
2019-12-17,Faber,,,@Saniel nice
2019-12-17,Faber,,,"@Saniel what’s cooking up there, dude?"
2019-12-17,Saniel,,,@Faber I have decided. I assume you know of the Voyager probes?
2019-12-17,Faber,,,@Saniel definitely. tiny little bits of hardware sailing off into the deep black… some seriously good engineering on those things.
2019-12-17,Saniel,,,"@Faber Yes, well, you know there was a golden record attached to one of those probes – it contained greetings, music, and messages that tried to represent as much of Earth’s culture as possible. I’m going to create a copy. That will be my gift."
2019-12-17,Faber,,,"@Saniel awesome! that’s more like it, something unexpected, from the heart. great present!"

2019-11-12,Saniel,,,"@Riley No need to thank me… although if you were to free up tomorrow evening, I have quite a few back-issues of the Journal of Computational Linguistics that could use sorting and shelving."
