HOLIDAYPOSTER_QUIT,See you later!,,,,
HOLIDAYPOSTER_1,"Hey, <b>{{user_name}}</b>, you’ve learned the basics of HTML and CSS already - so let's use those skills to make a poster. You can use this technique to create posters for lots of different occasions, like holidays, birthdays, graduations, whatever you like!",riley,,,
HOLIDAYPOSTER_2,"Like our previous HTML adventures, if the previewer page doesn't open, try opening your browser or clicking this link: <u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4"">https://codepen.io/madetohack/pen/abzNgQe?editors=1100</span></u>",riley,,,
HOLIDAYPOSTER_3,"Ok, let's take a minute to look over the code in the HTML and CSS sections. The code in the HTML section is the basic skeleton we'll use for this project, and the code in the CSS section includes the basic style.",riley,,,
HOLIDAYPOSTER_4,"Let’s start with the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">text-align</span></tt> property in the CSS section. What do you think happens when you change the word <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">center</span></tt> to <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">left</span></tt> or <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">right</span></tt>? Give it a try, and see if your prediction was right!",riley,,,
HOLIDAYPOSTER_5,"When you're done, change the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">text-align</span></tt> property back to <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">center</span></tt>.",riley,,,
HOLIDAYPOSTER_6,"Great! Now, let’s give the poster some color. Within the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">div</span></tt> brackets ( <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">{}</span></tt> ), add a new line and type the following: <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">background: yellow;</span></tt>  If you did it right, the background of the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;div&gt;</span></tt> should now be yellow.",riley,,,
HOLIDAYPOSTER_7,"Let’s try adding some flair to the edges of your card - Check out the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">border</span></tt> property in the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">div</span></tt> section. Right now, it's <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">2px solid black</span></tt>. What happens if we change it to... <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">4px dotted green</span></tt>? Let's do it!",riley,,,
HOLIDAYPOSTER_8,"Nice! Try adding this property too: <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">border-radius: 40px;</span></tt>",riley,,,
HOLIDAYPOSTER_9,Wow! It looks like your poster is starting to take shape.,riley,,,
HOLIDAYPOSTER_10,"Hmm, I can't make out what the image is. Try changing the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">width</span></tt> of the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">div</span></tt> to <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">400px</span></tt>.",riley,,,
HOLIDAYPOSTER_11,"That's still pretty unclear. What do you think we should do about that? What happens if you replace <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">width: 400px;</span></tt> with <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">max-width:100%;</span></tt> ?",riley,,,
HOLIDAYPOSTER_12,"The window is as big as it can get, and the image <b>still</b> isn't right, darn. Well, we can't just leave it like that. Maybe we need to tweak the image itself? There's always more than one way to solve a problem!",riley,,,
HOLIDAYPOSTER_13,"Let's fix that image, and to do that, we need to add some CSS that defines properties for the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;img&gt;</span></tt> tag, which stands for... you guessed it, <b>image</b>.",riley,,,
HOLIDAYPOSTER_14,"Add a few lines under the closing bracket ( <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">}</span></tt> ) of the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">div</span></tt> section, and add the following: <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">img { }</span></tt>",riley,,,
HOLIDAYPOSTER_15,"Let’s add a new property into the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">img</span></tt> tag: <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">max-width: 75%;</span></tt>  This property says ""this image can only be as wide as 75% of the page, at most.""",riley,,,
HOLIDAYPOSTER_16,"That image is looking a little tight against the border, so let's fix that by adding some <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">padding</span></tt> in the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">img</span></tt> section - check the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">div</span></tt> CSS for clues.",riley,,,
HOLIDAYPOSTER_17,"As you can see in the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">div</span></tt> CSS, you'd want to add <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">padding: 10px;</span></tt> in the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">img</span></tt> section. Make a new line under the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">max-width</span></tt> section, and write it there.",riley,,,
HOLIDAYPOSTER_18,"Perfect. Your cookie should now fit comfortably inside the poster. No matter how you resize the window, the cookie should be nice and snug - test it out!",riley,,,
HOLIDAYPOSTER_19,"Now, let's style the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">h1</span></tt> tags. Add a new entry in the CSS pane, under the image CSS: <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">h1 { }</span></tt>",riley,,,
HOLIDAYPOSTER_20,"To change <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">h1</span></tt>'s font, we need to add some code between those curly braces: <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">font-family: Impact;</span></tt> and then on the next line,  <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">font-size: 50pt;</span></tt>",riley,,,
HOLIDAYPOSTER_21,"Check out how your text changed. Cool, right? But... do you see that weird space there, between the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">h1</span></tt> and <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">h3</span></tt> text? Let's fix that.",riley,,,
HOLIDAYPOSTER_22,"Add <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">margin: 10px;</span></tt> into your <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">h1</span></tt> CSS, and that should do it. Remember, if you're trying to fix a problem in CSS, you can do it by adjusting the problem tag, or your can just adjust the tags that interact with the problem tag. Think laterally!",riley,,,
HOLIDAYPOSTER_23,"Let's get even fancier! Try adding this to your <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">h1</span></tt> CSS: <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">text-decoration: underline;</span></tt>",riley,,,
HOLIDAYPOSTER_24,"Sweeeet. What do think might happen if you tried adding <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">overline</span></tt> to <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">text-decoration: underline;</span></tt> ? Give it a shot, try <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">text-decoration: underline overline;</span></tt>",riley,,,
HOLIDAYPOSTER_25,"Weird, right? Speaking of weird, what do you think would happen if you created a CSS section for the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">h4</span></tt> tag, and added <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">color: #181866;</span></tt>?",riley,,,
HOLIDAYPOSTER_26,"Yep, nothing. There's no <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">h4</span></tt> content on the page!",riley,,,
HOLIDAYPOSTER_27,"Alright, here we are at the final steps. Add your own message to the poster!",riley,,,
HOLIDAYPOSTER_28,Way to go! You've created your first poster!,riley,,,
HOLIDAYPOSTER_29,"If you want to try some advanced practice: Try changing the style of the text on your own. Start by using the name of the color, like <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">color: green;</span></tt>, and then use a hex color code. When you're done with that, try adding additional styles like bold or italics. It's gonna look awesome!",riley,,,
HOLIDAYPOSTER_30,"Take a screenshot of your poster and share it with your family and friends! If you share it online, don't forget to tag the Hack team with the hashtag <b>#MadeToHack</b>. See you on the internet!",riley,,,
