P5JSINTRO4_QUEST_SUBTITLE,What you'll do,,,,
P5JSINTRO4_QUEST_DESCRIPTION,"Learn how to make other shapes, etc. and unlock the full potential of P5JS (Part 4)",,,,
P5JSINTRO4_1,"You're back! You must love programming as much as I do! Let's start by opening the editor: <u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4"">https://editor.p5js.org</span></u> (if you don't already have it open).",riley,,,
P5JSINTRO4_2,"It might seem like I know everything there is to know about <b>p5.js</b>, but I'll that's only because I started learning it a couple weeks before you did. There's still a lot I don't know, and I want to explore it with you. Problems can be a lot easier with a partner!",riley,,,
P5JSINTRO4_3,Let me show you the <b>p5.js</b> version of the Academy Archives - it's where I learned everything I know about it.,riley,,,
P5JSINTRO4_4,"If you look up at the menus at the top, you'll see a menu called <b>Help</b>.",riley,,,
P5JSINTRO4_5,"Click on it, and you'll see an option called <b>Reference</b>. That's where we want to go.",riley,,,
P5JSINTRO4_6,"I know the Reference can be overwhelming at first - there's a <b>huge</b> amount of information here. Let's look up something we already know about - the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">background()</span></tt> command.",riley,,,
P5JSINTRO4_7,"If you can't find it, use <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Ctrl+F</span></tt> to search on the page. That's how I usually find what I'm looking for on reference pages. Once you find it, click the link to take us in.",riley,,,
P5JSINTRO4_8,"OK, now we're on the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">background()</span></tt> reference page. At the top, you'll see lots of different examples of how to use this bit of code.",riley,,,
P5JSINTRO4_9,"The first example just has a number in the parentheses - that's what we started off with in the very first quest, remember? I always wondered what it meant...",riley,,,
P5JSINTRO4_10,"Oh, I see - it's a <b>grayscale</b> number, a value between 0 and 255 that tells you how dark or light the gray should be.",riley,,,
P5JSINTRO4_11,"If you look down a few entries, you'll see <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">background('red');</span></tt> - that's how we set the color the first time.",riley,,,
P5JSINTRO4_12,"A little ways down, there's <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">background('#222222');</span></tt> - there's the hex color format we used later!",riley,,,
P5JSINTRO4_13,"Wow, there's so many different ways to set the background color! Scrolling down even further, you can read about how it works. ",riley,,,
P5JSINTRO4_14,"Let's go back and check out another entry. Click the back button, then find <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">circle()</span></tt> on the page.",riley,,,
P5JSINTRO4_15,"This one's a lot simpler, there's only one example and it looks just like what we used!",riley,,,
P5JSINTRO4_16,"If you scroll down to the <b>Syntax</b> section, you'll see how to use it: with three different numbers that represent the x, y, and diameter.",riley,,,
P5JSINTRO4_17,"Here in the reference, they use the placeholders <b>x</b>, <b>y</b>, and <b>d</b> for those numbers, and they explain what each one means in the section below.",riley,,,
P5JSINTRO4_18,"The section below is called <b>Parameters</b>, and that's what you call each of the things inside the parentheses of a function like <b>circle()</b>.",riley,,,
P5JSINTRO4_19,"So the <b>parameters</b> of the <b>circle()</b> function are the X-coordinate, the Y-coordinate, and the diameter.",riley,,,
P5JSINTRO4_20,"Okay, now that we know how to read these reference entries, let's go find a new function to look up, like <b>square()</b>.",riley,,,
P5JSINTRO4_21,See if you can use the reference for <b>square()</b> to draw your own square in the editor!,riley,,,
P5JSINTRO4_22,"I did <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">square(mouseX, mouseY, 50);</span></tt> to get a square with 50-pixel sides that follows my mouse around - That's a cool new paintbrush!",riley,,,
P5JSINTRO4_23,"There are also two other parts of this site that have been super useful to me - If you look on the left side of the reference page, you'll see <b>Learn</b> and <b>Examples</b>.",riley,,,
P5JSINTRO4_24,Click around each of those sections to find out more about the possibilities of <b>p5.js</b>!,riley,,,
P5JSINTRO4_25,That's all for now - I can't wait to see what amazing things you'll create! Isn't programming cool?,riley,,,
