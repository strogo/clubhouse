You need to download it from the App Center because we'll be using it for this activity.

Click the icon named <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">App Center</span></tt> on the Desktop, then search for <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Sublime Text</span></tt>, and install it.",,,,
BOOTQUEST_1,"Hiya, <b>{{user_name}}</b>! You've been doing some great website work so far - but I'm sure you've wondered if there was a <b>really</b> fast way to build a website.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_2,"Well, there is! There's lots of code out there in these big collections called <b>libraries</b>- grab one of those, and you've got a ton of basic (and sometimes advanced!) functions and pieces already figured out for you. ",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_3,"We've already hooked up all the Bootstrap bits for you - it's going to do all the heavy lifting so you can concentrate on designing the website. Let's take a look at the toolbox you'll use. If your browser doesn’t open, click on the following link: <u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4"">https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/components/</span></u>",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_4,"These <b>Components</b> are all included in <b>Bootstrap</b>. All you have to do is paste some code into your webpage, and then they'll show up in their full glory.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_5,"Ok, let's get started on your webpage. If your browser doesn’t open, click on the following link: <u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4"">https://codepen.io/Hack-Computer/pen/ExamVOm</span></u>",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_6,You're already familiar with Codepen - let's add some Bootstrap bits to the site.,daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_7,"Let's add a <b>Carousel</b> to your page - lots of websites have these, it's that big image at the top that changes every so often. Go back to your Bootstrap Comonents page and on the left side, there's a scrolling section - Click on the <b>Carousel</b> link, it's the 7th down from the top. ",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_8,"In the center section, under the <b>Carousel</b> heading, find the section called <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">With controls</span></tt>. Just under the image, you’ll see a bit of code with a <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">copy</span></tt> link at the top right corner. Click the link to copy the code.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_9,"Go back to your CodePen, and paste that code (Ctrl + V) onto <b>line 10</b> of the HTML pane. You won't notice a huge change in the preview, because we haven't set up any images yet. Let's do that now.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_10,"In the HTML pane, find the first <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">img src=""...""</span></tt> section and replace the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">...</span></tt> with <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF""><u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4"">https://bit.ly/happycat1</span></u></span></tt> Don't forget to keep the quotation marks. :) The line should look like this: <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;img src=""<u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4"">https://bit.ly/happycat1</span></u>"" class=""d-block w-100"" alt=""...""&gt;</span></tt>",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_11,"Boom, the <b>Carousel</b> appeared with an image. Great job! Now do the same thing for the other two <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;img&gt;</span></tt> tags using <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF""><u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4"">https://bit.ly/catpicture1</span></u></span></tt> and <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF""><u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4"">https://bit.ly/gingie</span></u></span></tt>.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_12,Awesome! Now your <b>Carousel</b> will rotate between three images.,daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_13,"Let's try adding another Bootstrap Component to your page - Let's use a <b>Jumbotron</b>, and show off some text in a big way!",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_14,"Like we did for the <b>Carousel</b>, find the <b>Jumbotron</b> section on the left-hand side of the Bootstrap Components page. Click it, then scroll down in the main part of the page until you find the <b>Fluid Jumbotron</b>.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_15,"Underneath the <b>Fluid Jumbotron</b> text, you'll see another <b>Copy</b> link inside a grey block of code. Click the <b>Copy</b> link to copy the code. ",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_16,"Go back to your CodePen, and paste that code (Ctrl + V) under the <b>Carousel</b> code, on <b>line 34</b>. You should now see the same block that was displayed on the Bootstrap page just under your carousel. Cool, right?",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_17,"Awesome! Nice job on the <b>Jumbotron</b> and <b>Carousel</b>, your site is beginning to look professional! Let's keep it going, and add one last Bootstrap Component - A card deck!",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_18,"Head back to the Bootstrap Components page on Chrome, and find the <b>Card</b> section on the left-hand side. Click <b>Cards</b>, then look on the right side of the page, and find <b>Card Decks</b>. Click that text to jump right to that section.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_19,"Now that you're looking at the <b>Card Decks</b>, find the grey code box, and click the <b>Copy</b> link to copy the code. Go back to your CodePen, and paste that code (Ctrl + V) under the <b>Fluid Jumbotron</b> code, on <b>line 41</b>. Don't worry if it looks odd; we'll fix that in a minute.",,,,
BOOTQUEST_20,"Like the <b>Carousel</b>, the <b>Card Deck</b> will show up with no images at first, so let's add some. Find the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">img src=""...""</span></tt> sections and replace the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">...</span></tt> with <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF""><u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4"">https://bit.ly/happycat1</span></u></span></tt>",,,,
BOOTQUEST_21,"You did it! By completing this activity, you learned how to create a website using Bootstrap. You're a Web Designer! If you would like to save your work, ask for your parent's permission to create a Codepen account.",,,,
