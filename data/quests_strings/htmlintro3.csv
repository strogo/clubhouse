HTMLINTRO3_QUEST_SUBTITLE,What you'll do,,,,
HTMLINTRO3_QUEST_DESCRIPTION,"Learn how to play with HTML text sizes, more styles, and images! (Part 3)",,,,
HTMLINTRO3_1,You're probably wondering if you can change text in other ways than just the color.,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_2,"<b>Yes, you can.</b> I mean, I've been doing it this whole time!",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_3,"Let's get back into that HTML previewer, I've got a new page for you.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_4,"Like last time, if it doesn't open, try opening your web browser.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_5,"You can also click the link - <u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4"">https://codepen.io/madetohack/pen/oNNYNXB?editors=1000</span></u>",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_6,"You'll notice that there's more text this time, so let's make the first paragraph stand out! Add the tags <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;b&gt;</span></tt> and <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;/b&gt;</span></tt> around the first sentence.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_7,"Bold! You might have noticed that after you typed the opening <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;b&gt;</span></tt> tag, everything in the entire page went bold until you typed the closing <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;/b&gt;</span></tt> tag.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_8,"If you don't close tags, they apply until the end of the page, which is pretty much never what you want. So if you see something wierd, check your tags!",,,,
HTMLINTRO3_9,"Along with bold text, you can also use italics, by putting <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;i&gt;</span></tt> and <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;/i&gt;</span></tt> around some text. You can even combine bold and italics - just put both sets of tags around the same text.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_10,"Now, let's try changing the size of the text. Size works like color, so it goes inside the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;p&gt;</span></tt> tag.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_11,"Try <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;p style=""font-size:200%""&gt;</span></tt> on a paragraph.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_12,"See how that's similar to what we did with colors? We're adding another 'style' to the text, but this one talks about size.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_13,"You can also use words like <b>xx-large</b> and <b>small</b> for <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">font-size</span></tt>, instead of percentages. Here's a link to the W3Schools page with more info: <u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4"">https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_font.asp</span></u>",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_14,"Now, we know that colors and sizes are just adding styles to the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;p&gt;</span></tt> tag, so check this out: You can combine them!",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_15,"Let's make the text in one of the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;p&gt;</span></tt> tags double-size and red: <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;p style=""font-size:200%; color:red""&gt;</span></tt> Do you see where the semicolon (;) is?",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_16,The semicolon tells the browser that we're separating 2 different formatting instructions.,,,,
HTMLINTRO3_17,"I take back what I said earlier - now <b>THAT</b> pops. Remember, you can also add these styles to <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;h1&gt;</span></tt>, <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;h2&gt;</span></tt>, and so on.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_18,"Try making your <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;h1&gt;</span></tt> text green and tiny!",,,,
HTMLINTRO3_19,"One way you might do that is by typing <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;h1 style=""font-size:x-small; color:lightgreen""&gt;</span></tt>",,,,
HTMLINTRO3_20,"Great work so far! Now that you know how to make text look different, how about adding an image?",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_21,"The <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;img&gt;</span></tt> tag is different than the other ones we've seen so far. It <b>requires</b> some additional information in order to work.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_22,"You can't just type <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;img&gt;</span></tt>, it needs the web address of the image to display, otherwise there's nothing for the browser to show!",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_23,"Try typing this into the code of the webpage - <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;img src=""<u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4"">http://www.w3schools.com/html/img_chania.jpg</span></u>""&gt;</span></tt>",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_24,"The <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">src</span></tt> part of the tag you can think of as the <b>source</b>. That's where the image is located. In this case, it's on another website.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_25,Your image should show up when you finish the tag - and take a look at the way that tag is written. Does that look familiar?,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_26,"Think back to when we were styling text (<tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">p style</span></tt>) and how that tag was written. Look at the first parts of those two tags:",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_27,"<tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;img src=""<u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4"">https://...</span></u></span></tt>",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_28,"<tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;p style=""color...</span></tt>",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_29,"Do you see how there's a tag (<tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">p</span></tt> or <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">img</span></tt>), then a modifier (<tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">style</span></tt> or <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">src</span></tt>), and then information that applies to that modifier?",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_30,"HTML has consistent rules that you can learn, like any language. All tags follow this same basic format, and most of them even accept the same modifiers.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_31,"If you can master the rules of HTML, you'll be able to use any tag, even ones you've never seen before.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_32,"Awesome work! I'll be waiting in the Clubhouse to show you a secret trick that ties all of this together, and makes it a lot easier, too.",riley,,,
