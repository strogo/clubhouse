P5JSSOUND1_QUEST_NAME,P5JS - Painting with Sound - Part 1,,,,
P5JSSOUND1_QUEST_SUBTITLE,What you'll do,,,,
P5JSSOUND1_QUEST_DESCRIPTION,Let's start building a way to visualize music in the first part of this activity series!,,,,
P5JSSOUND1_1,"Have you ever wanted to make your own music visualizer? If so, now is your chance with p5.js.",daemon,,,
P5JSSOUND1_2,"<b>p5.js</b> has a live online editor we can use - If it doesn't open automatically, use this link: <u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4"">https://editor.p5js.org/</span></u>",daemon,,,
P5JSSOUND1_3,"Every p5.js sketch has 2 main parts, <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">setup()</span></tt> and <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">draw()</span></tt>. <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">setup()</span></tt> runs once, at the beginning, and <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">draw()</span></tt> runs over and over until the program is stopped.",daemon,,,
P5JSSOUND1_4,"Have you ever wondered what <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">setup()</span></tt> and <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">draw()</span></tt> <b>are</b>, though? To answer that, let’s look down at line 6, where you can see <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">background(220)</span></tt>.",daemon,,,
P5JSSOUND1_5,"You’ve changed the background color of a p5.js sketch before by changing the number inside the parentheses – from 220 to maybe, 160, or 20. that works because <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">background()</span></tt> is running a function – a tiny piece of code that lives somewhere else.",daemon,,,
P5JSSOUND1_6,"220 is what we call a <b>parameter</b> - information that we send into the function to help the function do its job. So what you’re saying when you write <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">background(220)</span></tt> is “Send the number 220 to the background function, and tell it to do its thing!”",daemon,,,
P5JSSOUND1_7,"The <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">createCanvas()</span></tt> function on line 2 is similar - “Send the numbers 400 and 400 to createCanvas, and tell it to do its thing!” Each function will do different things with the info you send it - <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">createCanvas()</span></tt> sets the width and height of our “drawing area,” for example.",daemon,,,
P5JSSOUND1_8,"OK, enough theory – let’s get to sound-painting. Inside the curly braces ( <b>{}</b> ) for <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">setup()</span></tt>, create a new line below the line with <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">createCanvas(400,400)</span></tt> on it. Type this on that line - <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">input = new p5.AudioIn();</span></tt> Don’t forget the semicolon at the end, and double-check your capitalization!",daemon,,,
P5JSSOUND1_9,"This line lets us assign our audio input to a simple word, <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">input</span></tt>, so we can refer to it more easily later – like right now! On the line below, type <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">input.start()</span></tt>",daemon,,,
P5JSSOUND1_10,"Now, once the program passes that line, it will be listening to the input from your microphone. Let’s do something with what it’s hearing! To do that, we need to move into <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">draw()</span></tt>.",daemon,,,
P5JSSOUND1_11,"Inside the curly braces ( <b>{}</b> ) for <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">draw()</span></tt>, make a new line below the line with <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">background(220)</span></tt> and type <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">let volume = input.getLevel();</span></tt>",daemon,,,
P5JSSOUND1_12,"Like the previous line, this is linking some information into a simple word, so we can refer to it more easily later.",daemon,,,
P5JSSOUND1_13,"Now, let’s draw a dancing circle! Create a new line after the one with <b>volume</b> on it, and type <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">circle(width/2, height/2, volume*100);</span></tt>",daemon,,,
P5JSSOUND1_14,"That’s going to place a circle at the center of the canvas, with a size equal to <b>volume * 100</b>! Now, press the Play button in the upper left, and clap near your microphone!",daemon,,,
P5JSSOUND1_15,"You might get a popup asking if it’s ok for the website to use your microphone – Go ahead and allow it. If you still don’t see a circle showing up when you clap, we'll need to check some more settings.",daemon,,,
P5JSSOUND1_16,"To check your microphone, look in the <b>far bottom right</b> corner of the whole screen. You'll see a little picture, or a letter in a circle there. Click that, and it'll pop up a menu. From that menu, click <b>Settings</b>",daemon,,,
P5JSSOUND1_17,"Once the <b>Settings App</b> opens, scroll down the left side to the Sound section and click it.",daemon,,,
P5JSSOUND1_18,"Once you’re in the sound settings, scroll down on the right side of the Settings App until you find the volume slider for the microphone – make sure it’s about halfway up. Once you’ve done that, close the settings app, and your circle should respond to claps!",daemon,,,
P5JSSOUND1_19,"Cool, huh? It’s gonna get even cooler in the next part, now that we’ve done all the setup! See you soon!",daemon,,,
