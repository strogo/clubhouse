KRITAANIM_QUEST_SUBTITLE,What you'll do,,,,
KRITAANIM_QUEST_DESCRIPTION,Create a simple animation using Krita.,,,,
KRITAANIM_1,"Have you ever wanted to make your own movie? Using Krita, you can animate your drawings to make a story. Give me a minute to open up Krita, and we'll get moving!",daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM_2,"First, you'll want to create a New File. (Look next to the word Start) We can customize it before we even start drawing.",daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM_3,"On the left sidebar, select <b>Custom Document</b> (if it isn't already selected).",daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM_4,"Let's make our <b>width</b> 800, and the <b>height</b> 400. You can set these to whatver you like in the future, but this will do for now. ",daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM_5,"We'll keep the <b>resolution</b> at <b>100 ppi</b> or, pixels per inch. The higher the resolution, the closer you can zoom in before the picture looks weird. We're going to leave it right where it is. Click the <b>Create</b> button on the bottom right.",daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM_6,"Each box on the edge of Krita's window is called a <b>Docker</b>. You customize and change them, but right now, we need to make sure we have the right ones to get animating. Click <b>Settings</b>, then <b>Dockers</b>, then <b>Timeline</b>.",daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM_7,"That's given us the tools to move backwards and forwards in time, now we need to control how fast the animation is, and how long it plays for. Click <b>Settings</b>, then <b>Dockers</b>, then <b>Animation</b>.",daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM_8,"Animations are measured in something called <b>frames</b>. I'm sure you've see a movie before - but did you know that every movie is actually just a really long series of still images that are being shown to you really, really fast? It's like a slideshow that's going super fast - 24 times a second, actually!",daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM_9,"Those images that are strung together to create the movie are called the <b>frames</b>. For animation, we have to draw the frames ourselves... but there are some tricks we can use to reduce our work a little - for example, we won't be drawing 24 frames for every second of animation!",daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM_10,"Now I'll explain some of those buttons in the Animation Docker (bottom left). The bottom middle button should already be selected. It turns <b>Auto Frame Mode</b> on or off. Usually, we want it on. Can you double check that? Just hover the cursor over it if you're not sure.",daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM_11,"Now, in the Timeline, you'll see that the first frame is selected. If we edit the image right now, we'll be changing the first frame. All the frames are numbered, but Krita doesn't show every number - that'd be hard to read!",daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM_12,"We're going to make a short animation of a smiling face. After that, you'll be ready to make your own stuff! ",daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM_13,"Before we do anything else, let's make sure we have a nice clean <b>layer</b> to start drawing on. See the <b>Layers</b> Docker on the right? Click the <b>plus button</b> to add a new one!",daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM_14,"Now, click the little orange dot on the timeline docker, just to the right of where it says <b>Layer 1</b> (or whatever you named your layer). The little box that represents the <b>frame</b> should now be orange-tinted. You need to select this first <b>frame</b> so that Krita knows we want to make an animation. Next, click the button in the Animation Docker called <b>Add Blank Frame</b>. It's on the far left, across from <b>Play Speed</b>.",daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM_15,"Now we can start drawing. If we tried to do this before we selected the first frame and then added a blank frame, Krita would only let us draw on all the frames at once - and that's not what we want! Now, click on the <b>Ellipse Tool</b>, It looks like a circle on the left toolbar.",daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM_16,"Our circle should be black - this is just going to be the outline of our smiley face. Go to the colorful triangle with a rainbow ring around it, in the upper right, and click on the inner triangle where it's colored black.",daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM_17,"If you click and drag the mouse on the canvas, you should be able to create a circle or oval. If you want it to be perfectly circular, hold the <b>Shift</b> key while you're dragging the mouse. If the circle doesn't turn out how you want, you can press <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Ctrl + Z</span></tt> to <b>Undo</b>.",daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM_18,"Once you've got the circle how you like it, let's pick another color to be the inside of the face - how about yellow? Go to the colorful triangle with a rainbow ring around it again, but this time, click on the outer ring where the color is close to what you want.",daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM_19,"The inner triangle will change to shade from your color, to white, to black. Click or drag inside the triangle until you find the color you want.",daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM_20,"Now, we'll need the <b>Fill Tool</b> to fill in that circle. It looks like a paint bucket that's about to pour paint, with just a drip coming off the edge. Look near the middle of the toolbar on the far left of the screen. If you hover your cursor over a tool, the name will pop up after a minute.",daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM_21,"Once the <b>Fill Tool</b> is selected, you can click anywhere and it will fill that area with the color you have selected. Try clicking in the middle of your circle.",daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM_22,Now we're going to draw the eyes on our smiley face. We'll use the <b>Ellipse Tool</b> again.,daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM_23,"Pick what color you want the eyes to be using the triangle, and draw them using the <b>Ellipse Tool</b>.",daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM_24,"Looking good! Now, we're going to use the <b>Freehand Brush Tool</b> (it looks like a paintbrush) to draw the very beginning of a smile. You'll only need a small straight line, low on the face. ",daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM_25,"Now, on to the next frame! You can click on the next frame in the <b>Timeline</b>, use the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Right Arrow Key (→)</span></tt> while you have the <b>Timeline</b> selected, or click the right-facing arrow button next to the <b>Play</b> button.",daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM_26,"Now, start your paintbrush just inside one edge of the mouth. Paint a line outward, tracing what you already have, until you just pass the end of it. The mouth shouldn't look very different, but that's okay.",daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM_27,"Next, you'll do the same thing on the other side of the mouth. Remember not to go very far past the end of your first line! In animation, you want each frame to be just a TINY change. When you add them all up and play them real fast, it looks like it's really moving!",daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM_28,"Now we need to edit the next frame. Remember, you can click on the next frame in the <b>Timeline</b>, use the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Right Arrow Key (→)</span></tt> while you have the <b>Timeline</b> selected, or click the right-facing arrow button next to the <b>Play</b> button.",daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM_29,"Maybe you already guessed, but we're going to do a very similar thing as we did in the last frame. Start a line inside what you've already drawn, then trace it out till you just pass the edge. We're going to increase the smile this way, a tiny bit in each frame, until it's big enough.",daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM_30,"Try using the left and right arrow keys to move around in the Timeline. This helps you get an idea of where the movement is, and whether you're making changes at a steady rate.",daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM_31,"Now, when you've made enough frames for your smile and you think it's big enough, it's time to tell Krita where your animation ends. Select the last frame you made changes to, and look at the big box to the left to see what frame number it is.",daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM_32,"Now, you can type that number into a box on the right of the Animation Docker, labeled <b>End</b>.",daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM_33,"<b>Start</b> and <b>End</b> tell Krita which frames your animation starts and ends on. If you don't set at least the end, the animation will go on for a really long time!",daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM_34,"Now that you've set which frames will be used in your movie, you can hit the big <b>Play</b> button in the <b>Animation Docker</b> to watch it!",daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM_35,"If your animation doesn't seem to be playing right, you can try pressing a special button called <b>Drop Frames</b>. It's in the <b>Animation Docker</b>, just to the right of the <b>Auto Frame Mode</b> button. But what does it do?",daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM_36,"When <b>Drop Frames</b> is turned on, Krita will notice when your computer has trouble keeping up with the animation and changing frames fast enough. When this happens, it will skip frames to keep the animation running at the expected speed.",daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM_37,"If <b>Drop Frames</b> is turned off, you will always see every frame in the movie. It just might pause and lag a bit at points. You can try playing your movie with <b>Drop Frames</b> turned on and off. What do you notice is different?",daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM_38,Now you've made your very first animation! Professional animators use short animations like this to build their skills and test out new concepts. What can you make next?,daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM_39,"You did such a good job on this animation, I can't wait to see what you'll make on your own! See you in the next activity!",daemon2,,,
