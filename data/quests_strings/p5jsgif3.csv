P5JSGIF3_QUEST_DESCRIPTION,"Fill the canvas with your collage, and show it off to your friends!",,,,
P5JSGIF3_1,"Hi <b>{{user_name}}</b>, welcome back!",daemon,,,
P5JSGIF3_2,"First things first - let's get back to the p5.js code editor. You can load your previous sketch (if you saved it at <u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4"">http://editor.p5js.org</span></u> ), or get back to where we left off: <u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4"">https://editor.p5js.org/madetohack/sketches/okIyaVEw</span></u>",daemon,,,
P5JSGIF3_3,"Last time, you took control of your gif with the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">mousePressed()</span></tt> and <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">mouseReleased()</span></tt> <b>functions</b>. Now we’re going to fill the canvas!",daemon,,,
P5JSGIF3_4,"A collage needs way more than 1 GIF! To add another GIF, first you need to find another GIF on giphy.",daemon,,,
P5JSGIF3_5,"Remember, once you find the GIF you like, click <b>Copy Link</b>, and then copy the <b>GIF Link</b> (the middle one) in the popup.",daemon,,,
P5JSGIF3_6,"Next, you need to add another line in the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">preload()</span></tt> <b>function</b> to load the GIF. You can copy the existing line you have, paste in your new GIF’s address, and change the name to <b>gif2</b>.",daemon,,,
P5JSGIF3_7,"You also need to duplicate the line inside <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">draw()</span></tt> that says <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">image(...</span></tt> - Replace the name in that line with the new GIF name you just created in <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">preload()</span></tt>. You’ll also need to change the position numbers, otherwise the images will overlap. It’ll take a few tries to get it lined up right!",daemon,,,
P5JSGIF3_8,"If you want this new image to react to a mouse click, you need to add it to the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">mousePressed()</span></tt> and <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">mouseReleased()</span></tt> <b>functions</b> - Just duplicate the line already there and change the name.",daemon,,,
P5JSGIF3_9,"After every step, be sure to run and test your code, to make sure you didn’t make any mistakes! Remember, everything has to be spelled and capitalized correctly.",daemon,,,
P5JSGIF3_10,"Repeat the whole duplication process a few times, and you’ll fill up your canvas in no time! Then, of course, you can always make it bigger, find even <b>MORE</b> GIFs, and keep adding them!",daemon,,,
P5JSGIF3_11,"Now go find someone and show them your P5.JS skills. If they ask how you did it… well, you can say you just <b>hacked</b> it together! See you around!",daemon,,,
