P5JSSOUND2_QUEST_NAME,P5JS - Painting with Sound - Part 2,,,,
P5JSSOUND2_QUEST_SUBTITLE,What you'll do,,,,
P5JSSOUND2_QUEST_DESCRIPTION,Continue your quest to turn sound into visuals by adding color and more detection logic!,,,,
P5JSSOUND2_1,"Hi there! I'm glad you're back, <b>{{user_name}}</b> - I've got something awesome to show you!",daemon,,,
P5JSSOUND2_2,"First things first - let's get back to the p5.js code editor. You can load your previous sketch  (if you saved it at <u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4"">http://editor.p5js.org</span></u> ), or get back to where we left off: <u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4"">https://editor.p5js.org/madetohack/sketches/7djSSUEJ</span></u>",daemon,,,
P5JSSOUND2_3,"Last time, we got a circle to dance around in response to the sounds coming through the microphone – this time, let’s change the way it reacts and add more color.",daemon,,,
P5JSSOUND2_4,"First, in order to draw a lot of things on top of the background, we need to move our <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">background()</span></tt> function <b>out</b> of <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">draw()</span></tt> and <b>into</b> <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">setup()</span></tt>. Can you think of why that might be?",daemon,,,
P5JSSOUND2_5,"We need to move that <b>function</b> because if it's in <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">setup()</span></tt>, it only runs once. In <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">draw()</span></tt> it’ll run and repaint the background constantly, which will “erase” anything we put on it.",daemon,,,
P5JSSOUND2_6,"Now, let’s change your code to only draw a circle if the volume is louder than certain number. To do that, first, let’s delete the current line that draws your circle, in <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">draw()</span></tt>",daemon,,,
P5JSSOUND2_7,"… And we’ll replace that line with the following: <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">if (volume &gt; 0.1) {</span></tt>  (press <b>Enter</b> twice for 2 new lines)  <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">}</span></tt>",daemon,,,
P5JSSOUND2_8,"That code says “If, when we get volume, it’s above 0.1, then do the stuff inside these curly braces. Otherwise, skip it and keep going.” I think you see why it’s usually called a <b>if statement</b>!",daemon,,,
P5JSSOUND2_9,"Right now, though, we aren’t doing anything inside that <b>if statement</b> - so let’s draw a circle! Inside the curly braces ( {} ) for the <b>if statement</b>, type this code: <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">circle(random(width), random(height), volume * 100);</span></tt>",daemon,,,
P5JSSOUND2_10,"That’s going to draw a circle in a random position, but at a similar range of sizes to the ‘dancing circle’ you had in the previous activity.",daemon,,,
P5JSSOUND2_11,Let’s run this code and see what happens – press the <b>play</b> button and make some noise!,daemon,,,
P5JSSOUND2_12,"Nice, but the screen filled up pretty quickly. Maybe we should repaint the background and erase all the circles if the volume gets <b>really</b> loud.",daemon,,,
P5JSSOUND2_13,"To do that, we need to add another <b>if statement</b>, below the first one. Make a new line after the final curly brace ( } ) of the first <b>if statement</b>...",daemon,,,
P5JSSOUND2_14,".. and type this: <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">if (volume &gt; 0.3) {</span></tt> (press <b>Enter</b> for a new line) <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">background(150,100,200);</span></tt> (press <b>Enter</b> for a new line) <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">}</span></tt>",daemon,,,
P5JSSOUND2_15,"Make sure that your <b>if statements</b> both have their own sets of curly braces ( {} ), and that there’s still one last closing curly brace ( } ) at the very end, to end <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">draw()</span></tt>.",daemon,,,
P5JSSOUND2_16,"Let’s run the code again – and this time, make some really loud noise every time to the screen gets too crowded.",daemon,,,
P5JSSOUND2_17,"Cool! Now, let’s add even more – how about some color?",daemon,,,
P5JSSOUND2_18,"We’ll add another <b>if statement</b>, below our previous one. Make a new line after the final curly brace ( } ) of the second <b>if statement</b>, and... ",daemon,,,
P5JSSOUND2_19,"You guessed it, type this text: <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">if (volume &gt; 0.2) {</span></tt> (press <b>Enter</b> for a new line) <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">}</span></tt>",daemon,,,
P5JSSOUND2_20,"That sets up our new <b>if statement</b>, now let's fill it.",daemon,,,
P5JSSOUND2_21,"Between the opening and closing curly braces ( {} ) you just added, type this: <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">fill(random(255), random(255), random(255))</span></tt> (press <b>Enter</b> for a new line) <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">circle(random(width), random(height), volume * 100);</span></tt>",daemon,,,
P5JSSOUND2_22,"That’s 2 lines you’ve added – the first one sets us a random color, and the second one you should recognize from the first <b>if statement</b> you wrote. This will make your circle a random color if the volume is above 0.2. Run it and watch the colors roll in!",daemon,,,
P5JSSOUND2_23,"Nice work! Are you ready to go ever further? I hope on, because the next activity is going to stretch your brain! See you there!",daemon,,,
