KRITACEL_1,"Hey there, <b>{{user_name}}</b>! I've got some fun drawing tips to teach you! Let's learn to add complex color and shading to your art! I'll pop Krita open for you, so we can get started.",daemon2,,,
KRITACEL_2,"We're going to use a file I've already prepared for this experiment! Click <b>Open File</b>, then, in the file browser that appears, select your <b>home directory</b> (the one with your name on it, on the left side). Next, navigate into your <b>Pictures</b> folder and then into <b>KritaSources</b>. Open <b>fire_girl.jpg</b>!",daemon2,,,
KRITACEL_3,"Now, we need to save this as a Krita file so you can add layers and all sorts of useful things to it - Go to <b>File</b>, then <b>Save As...</b>  - or press <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Ctrl + Shift + S</span></tt>.",daemon2,,,
KRITACEL_4,"In the box that pops up, navigate to wherever you want to save the file, and give it a nice name, like <b>fire<i>girl</i>with_shading</b>.",daemon2,,,
KRITACEL_5,"Right underneath the <b>File name</b> area, there's a <b>Files of type</b> area. Click that and select <b>Krita document</b> - that'll make sure we save this as Krita's file type!",daemon2,,,
KRITACEL_6,"Now that we've taken care of that, I'm going to show you how to make her colors pop off the page with <b>shading</b>. Shading is the skill of using color to show what parts of an object are well-lit, and which ones are in shadow. In real life, everything casts shadows, and they depend on where the light is coming from. In a drawing, you get to decide where that is!",daemon2,,,
KRITACEL_7,"First, select the <b>Contiguous Selection Tool</b>, which looks like a magic wand. It's next to all the dotted line icons. With that Tool selected, click on the hero's belly. See those rotating lines? That means this area is <b>selected</b> and anything we try to draw will only show up in that area. Neat, huh?",daemon2,,,
KRITACEL_8,"Before drawing anything, make a new Layer. Find the <b>Plus (+)</b> button at the bottom of the Layers list and click it. This lets us keep the shading seperate from the rest of the picture - you can even do a few different versions if you like! If you want, you can <b>double-click</b> the new Layer and rename it.",daemon2,,,
KRITACEL_9,"Still got that stomach area <b>selected</b>? Great! Choose the <b>Freehand Brush Tool</b>, which looks like a paintbrush next to the icon of a diagonal line. Hold the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Ctrl</span></tt> key while you click on the red color in your <b>selection</b>. Using <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Ctrl + Click</span></tt> sets your brush to the color that you clicked on - very handy!",daemon2,,,
KRITACEL_10,"We need a slightly darker color, though, because we're drawing a shadow. To choose a shadow color, go to the color selection triangle, and move the little circle more towards the top, where <b>black</b> is. You'll see 2 squares appear, to show you the previous color and the current one. Don't go all the way to black, but make sure there's a clear difference. ",daemon2,,,
KRITACEL_11,"Now that we have a good color, adjust your brush size to <b>10 or 15 pixels</b>. Let's assume the <b>light source</b> is on the top left, just off the edge of the page. That means there will be shadows on the opposite side of things. Think about what side of the character's stomach will be in shadow...",daemon2,,,
KRITACEL_12,"It's the bottom right side! Since she's flying at an angle, the <b>shading</b> will be all along her right side. If you have your new Layer highlighted in the list, and you also have that stomach area <b>selected</b>, you're ready to add your first shadow! Try drawing over the edge of the dotted line.",daemon2,,,
KRITACEL_13,"You should only see the new darker red color inside your <b>selection</b>. Trace the edge of her body to make a line of shadow. If you mess up, just use <b>Undo</b> (<tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Ctrl + Z</span></tt>) or the Eraser mode for your brush. You can select the eraser icon at the top of the page - It looks like a diagonal block eraser, next to the grey and white checkerboard square.",daemon2,,,
KRITACEL_14,"If you're having trouble getting the shading exactly where you want it, you can <b>Zoom</b> for a closer look. Look at the far bottom right of Krita's window, and you'll see a slider. You can drag this slider to adjust your zoom level, type a number, or hover over the button in the corner to use the dropdown menu that appears. When you want to see the whole picture again, you can zoom out using the slider or dropdown menu.",daemon2,,,
KRITACEL_15,"Once you have the shading where you like it, press <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Ctrl + Shift + A</span></tt> to <b>deselect</b> everything in the picture. Use the <b>Contiguous Selection Tool</b> (magic wand) again to select a different area of red, like her skirt. Once you have it selected, go back to your <b>Freehand Brush Tool</b> to start shading that area!",daemon2,,,
KRITACEL_16,"Remember, our <b>light source</b> is in the top left, so our <b>shading</b> will be along the bottom right. With the red skirt selected, trace the bottom right parts of her skirt. Try to slowly go out of the selection at each end. That will give the shadow a natural curve instead of looking like red paint.",daemon2,,,
KRITACEL_17,"You're doing great! Can you see the difference <b>shading</b> makes? This kind of <b>shading</b> with solid patches of color is called <b>cel shading</b>. It was originally used in animations - like Disney movies! To see what a difference your work made, you can click the <b>eye icon</b> next to your Layer.",daemon2,,,
KRITACEL_18,"Look at your shadows. Do they look realistic? If not, hide the ""dark red 1"" Layer and look carefully at the picture. Think about where things might stick out enough to block some light and cast a shadow. This step is crucial to good shading!",daemon2,,,
KRITACEL_19,"If the shadows look good, you can touch up your shading with a smaller Brush size, zooming way in. You can make parts of the lines thicker too, especially the stuff toward the bottom right.  If you want to get a little bit fancy, you can use a slightly smaller brush size (5-10px) to put shadows along the other lines in her skirt, where it wrinkles and folds. Remember! Shadows always go underneath the line because shadows are falling away from the <b>light source</b>. Try doing the rest of the red shading yourself!",daemon2,,,
KRITACEL_20,"When you've finished the <b>shading</b> in her uniform, mask, and boots, you'll see a big change from when you started! How does it look to you? What parts were hard or easy? Is there anything you'd do differently next time?",daemon2,,,
KRITACEL_21,"If you want to make all your shading a little lighter really quick, you can adjust the <b>Opacity</b> slider near the top of the <b>Layers Docker</b> to make your currnetly selected layer more see-through. The less <b>opaque</b> the Layer is, the paler the colors will be. Cool, huh? ",daemon2,,,
KRITACEL_22,"Now, let's make another layer for our next color of shading. Use the <b>Plus (+) Button</b> in the <b>Layers Docker</b>, and then you can double-click the new layer to rename it, if you want.",daemon2,,,
KRITACEL_23,"Next, select the <b>Contiguous Selection Tool</b> (magic wand) again, and use it to select some of our hero's skin. This is what we'll work on shading next!",daemon2,,,
KRITACEL_24,"Now, select the <b>Freehand Brush Tool</b> again, and <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Ctrl + Click</span></tt> a spot on our hero's skin to choose that color. Move the circle in the color triangle up a bit, enough to see a difference, but not too much. Now you're ready to start shading, don't forget where the shadows should fall!",daemon2,,,
KRITACEL_25,"In some spots on our hero's skin, you'll need to adjust the <b>selection area</b>. For example, you might have trouble selecting the edges of our hero's neck. If you try to paint there, it will still have a faint grey line around the border. To fix that, <b>Zoom</b> way in, then go back to the <b>magic wand</b> (contiguous selection tool) and <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Shift + Click</span></tt> the area you want to include. To remove an area from your selection, use <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Alt + Click</span></tt>.",daemon2,,,
KRITACEL_26,"Remember, if you ever do anything wrong or make a mistake, you can use <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Ctrl + Z</span></tt> to <b>Undo</b>! Once you finish our hero's skin, let's <b>shade</b> the yellow of her cape. You should remember how to do it now!",daemon2,,,
KRITACEL_27,"Wow, you've really made a difference on this picture! Don't forget to zoom out and check your work. Use the eye icons to make Layers appear and disappear. To make one color's <b>shading</b> paler, select the Layer and then adjust the <b>Opacity</b> slider above it.",daemon2,,,
KRITACEL_28,"When you finish doing this shading for each color, you can look at the whole thing. Hopefully it looks really good - and if not, don't worry! The only way to get better is keep practicing.",daemon2,,,
KRITACEL_29,"You've learned a lot today! As you go about your life, look at the shadows on everyday objects - I'll bet you'll see them in a new... light :D
Keep practicing, and don't forget to save. See ya!",daemon2,,,
