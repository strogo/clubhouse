KRITAPIXEL_QUEST_NAME,Pixel Art - Drawing with Squares,,,,
KRITAPIXEL_QUEST_SUBTITLE,What you'll do,,,,
KRITAPIXEL_QUEST_DESCRIPTION,"In this activity, you'll learn how to make ""pixel art"" in Krita, using special brushes and following a guide to create a smiley face (or frowny face).",,,,
KRITAPIXEL_1,"Have you ever heard of <b>Pixel Art</b>? If you've ever seen or played an old game from the early days of gaming, you might know about it. It's that blocky art style - kind of like what things look like in Minecraft. It's easy to learn, so come on into Krita with me!",daemon2,,,
KRITAPIXEL_2,"Once Krita's open, let's make a <b>New File</b>! Set the <b>Width</b> to <b>50 pixels</b>, set the <b>Height</b> to <b>50 pixels</b> too, then click <b>Create</b>!",daemon2,,,
KRITAPIXEL_3,"You might be wondering what a <b>pixel</b> actually is, though. It's the smallest dot of color that your computer screen can show! If you look really, really closely at your screen, you might be able to see that it's all made up of tiny squares! Try looking at the date and time down in the lower right corner - that's where it's usually easiest to see.",daemon2,,,
KRITAPIXEL_4,"A long time ago, computers couldn't draw tons of <b>pixels</b> on the screen at once - they were really slow! Artists had to get really good at making things look sort-of-right with very, very few pixels, and limited colors. There's a fun challenge, though, in figuring out how to do a lot with only a little!",daemon2,,,
KRITAPIXEL_5,"So, we're going to draw with those tiny squares and make tiny image! Let's get a better idea of how small our current drawing is - Go to the <b>Settings</b> menu, then <b>Dockers</b>, then select <b>Grid & Guides</b>. ",daemon2,,,
KRITAPIXEL_6,"When the <b>Grids & Guides</b> Docker appears, set the <b>X Spacing</b> to 1 px (1 pixel). It will automatically set the same for the Y spacing. Set the <b>Subdivision</b> to 1, too. Finally, <b>check</b> the box next to <b>Show grid</b>. This gives us lines that show us where all the pixels are!",daemon2,,,
KRITAPIXEL_7,"Today we're going to draw a happy face (or a frowny face if you prefer). First, we need a large circle. ",daemon2,,,
KRITAPIXEL_8,"Go to the <b>Brush Presets</b> Docker (remember, if it's not open, go to <b>Settings â†’ Dockers</b>), and use the dropdown menu to select <b>Pixel Art</b>. The Krita team has tools for this kind of project, too! For now, select the preset on the far right, the one that shows 2 circles as a sample. This brush will let us draw a large circle.",daemon2,,,
KRITAPIXEL_9,"Play around with the circle brush - remember, <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Ctrl + Z</span></tt> is <b>Undo</b>! Get your circle looking how you want it - and don't forget to set the color!",daemon2,,,
KRITAPIXEL_10,"Next, we'll start the eyes and mouth. Go back to the <b>Brush Selector</b> and find the <b>Pixel Art</b> brushes. Use the one on the left - it looks like a blue line of pixels.",daemon2,,,
KRITAPIXEL_11,"The brush is probably too big, so let's shrink it. Near the top of Krita, find the <b>Size</b> slider. You can drag the slider, or <b>right-click</b> the bar and type in a number. Set it to <b>1 px</b> (1 pixel). ",daemon2,,,
KRITAPIXEL_12,"Make your brush black, and start your smile by putting a dot in the bottom half of your face, at the center. You'll have to count pixels to make sure everything's centered, at first!",daemon2,,,
KRITAPIXEL_13,"After that, put a dot near the top, one one side. This will be the top of an eye. Count how many pixels are between the outside of the circle and the dot you placed. Now put a dot on the other side, making sure it's the same distance from the edge of the circle. Don't forget to make sure it's the same height, too!",daemon2,,,
KRITAPIXEL_14,"Now, add length to the eyes by coloring downward. Go down however much you think looks good! Remember, you can always go back and adjust it later.",daemon2,,,
KRITAPIXEL_15,"Now that you know how high the eye is, let's make it look round! With pixel art, the way to make something look curved is to draw pixels in a <b>stair-step</b> pattern - up one, over one, and so on. To make the curve more vertical, go up more before you go over. To make the curve gentler, go over more than you go up!",daemon2,,,
KRITAPIXEL_16,"From the bottom of the eye, move your cursor 1 pixel out and 1 pixel up, and add a black pixel there. Now, draw a line of pixels up from there and stop 1 pixel below the top of the eye. Do the same thing on the other side of the eye.",daemon2,,,
KRITAPIXEL_17,"Do you see how the <b>stair-step</b> at the top and bottom make the thick line start to look round? Keep drawing lines on either side of the eye until it's as wide as you want, then make the other eye match.",daemon2,,,
KRITAPIXEL_18,"This is starting to look pretty cool! In the Grids & Guides, try un-checking the box for ""Show grid"" and looking at your work in progress. When you're ready to start work again, check the box.",daemon2,,,
KRITAPIXEL_19,"Now it's time to add the rest of your smile (or frown). If you want to make a frown instead of a smile, just remember to drawn <b>down</b> whenever I say to draw <b>up</b>! ",daemon2,,,
KRITAPIXEL_20,"Starting at the lower dot in the center of your face, draw a line out to either side - about 6 to 10 pixels should do it. But, of course, make sure <b>you</b> think it looks right!",daemon2,,,
KRITAPIXEL_21,"Now, starting at the right end of your mouth, move your cursor 1 pixel out and 1 up, and then draw a 2-pixel line going to the right. Smiles have a slight curve at the beginning, and get more curved as they go out towards the edge of the face.",daemon2,,,
KRITAPIXEL_22,"Do it again - add another 2-pixel-long stair-step to the right of your current one. See how it's starting to look like a smile? Now add two 1-pixel stair-steps, diagonally up and to the right. That's the right side of your smile done!",daemon2,,,
KRITAPIXEL_23,"Now do the same thing on the left - two 2-pixel wide steps, then two 1-pixel steps. If you want your smiley to look a little overconfident, you can add more to one side or the other, for that lopsided look.",daemon2,,,
KRITAPIXEL_24,"Looking good, <b>{{user_name}}</b>! If you'd like, you can even add a nose - Just put a dot in the exact center of your face, and then build out from there, drawing a line that curves down at the sides. Or, you could leave it as just a dot.",daemon2,,,
KRITAPIXEL_25,"When it looks good to you, uncheck the <b>Show grid</b> box in the <b>Grids & Guides</b> Docker. You can use the scroll wheel on your mouse, or the slider in the bottom right, to zoom way out. When the smiley is very small, it looks just like an app icon... because this is still a way you make icons, even today!",daemon2,,,
KRITAPIXEL_26,"Thanks for making some pixel art with me today. I hope I've inspired you to do some more on your own, because Krita has tons of tools to help you out. Save and share your pixel art with someone who cares about you, and I'll see you next time! ",daemon2,,,
