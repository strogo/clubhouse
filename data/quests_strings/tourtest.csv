TOURTEST_ABORT,"OK, we can stop - but if you ever need to come back, you can &lt;HOW TO INVOKE HELP ON DEMAND&gt;",dood,,,
TOURTEST_QUIZ_INTRO,"Hey there, <b>{{user_name}}</b>! Welcome to Endless OS! Whenever you see a box like this, you can click the <b>‚ùØ</b> button to move to the next message.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_QUIZ_FIRSTCOMP,"Is this your first computer? If it is, I can go over some of the basics, like how to use the mouse and keyboard... and you might learn a few tricks, too!",dood,,,
TOURTEST_QUIZ_NOTFIRST,"Great, you know your way around already.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_QUIZ_ISFIRST,Congratulations! Let's get into the basics.,dood,,,
TOURTEST_QUIZ_OS,"OK. If you've used another computer before, what kind was it?
If you're not sure, select ""Windows"".",dood,,,
TOURTEST_QUIZ_OS_MAC,Mac (Apple),dood,,,
TOURTEST_QUIZ_OS_WIN,Windows (Microsoft),dood,,,
TOURTEST_QUIZ_END,"Great - I'll try and explain Endless OS in a way that matches your current computer, as well as ones you've used in the past.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_GREET,"OK, let's start! Endless OS is a little different from other computers you might have used before, but you can still do everything you need to.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_COMEBACK,"Once we're done, you can come back to this guide by &lt;HOW TO INVOKE HELP ON DEMAND&gt;.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_KBM1,"Now that we know what kind of computer you have, let's start learning about it.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_MOUSE1,"I know you've already figured out the basics of your mouse, since you're clicking on things on the screen! There are some other things that are important, though.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_MOUSE2,"The little arrow on the screen is called the <b>cursor</b> - so if I talk about moving the cursor somewhere, that means move your mouse so that the arrow on the screen does what it needs to.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_MOUSE_DESK1,"Your mouse usually has two buttons, <b>left</b> and <b>right</b>, and might also have a <b>scroll wheel</b> in the center.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_MOUSE_DESK2,"When something tells you to <b>click</b> or <b>left-click</b>, press the left mouse button down once. When something tells you to <b>right-click</b>, press the right mouse button. This is usually used for opening menus or lists of options.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_MOUSE_DESK3,"You can spin the wheel in the center of your mouse up and down to move the screen up and down when there's more than one screen of info in a program.
You can also click the wheel down to use the middle mouse button - it's rarely used, your mouse might not have one.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_MOUSE_LAP1,"Laptops usually have what is called a <b>touchpad mouse</b> or just a <b>touchpad</b>. It can have buttons, or it might just have areas drawn on its surface that let you <b>left-click</b> and <b>right-click</b>.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_MOUSE_LAP2,"If you don't have actual buttons on your touchpad, <b>clicking</b> means tapping on the touchpad, or pressing down until you hear a ""click."" When something tells you to <b>right-click</b>, you might have to press down with two fingers at once on the touchpad, or press the side of the touchpad - there's a lot of variation, take a minute to try it out.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_MOUSE_LAP3,Some touchpads support swiping with two fingers to scroll windows up and down. Try yours out and see!,dood,,,
TOURTEST_KB1,"Let's move on to the keyboard. You already know how to type all the normal keys, but in the future, you might need to type <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Ctrl + S</span></tt>, or <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Ctrl + (some other key)</span></tt>.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_KB2,"When something asks you to type <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Ctrl + S</span></tt>, that means press and hold <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Ctrl</span></tt> (pronounced as ""Control""), then press <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">S</span></tt>, then release both keys. You can hold <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Ctrl</span></tt> as long as you need to, but if you hold the other key for very long, it will repeat the command.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_KB3,"There are some other keys like <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Ctrl</span></tt> - <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Alt</span></tt>, and the key between <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Ctrl</span></tt> and <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Alt</span></tt>, which is usually called <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Win</span></tt> or ""the <b>Windows</b> Key"". On most keyboards it looks like the <b>Windows</b> logo - A square made of 4 squares. The squares may or may not be wavy.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_KB_LAP,"Most laptops also have a <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Function</span></tt> key. When used with the <b>F Keys</b> (<tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">F1</span></tt>-<tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">F12</span></tt>) on the top of your keyboard, this lets you do things like turn your Wi-Fi on/off, change the volume, and more.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_KB_DESK,"Your keyboard might have a square group of keys on the far right. These keys will type numbers if <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Num Lock</span></tt> is on (look for a little light at the top of the keyboard), and will act as arrow keys or other keys if <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Num Lock</span></tt> is off.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_USE,"Ok, now that you know more about controlling your computer, let's learn how to use it!",dood,,,
TOURTEST_USE1,"Endless OS is like any other computer - you can do anything you need to do, you just need to know <b>how</b> to do it.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_HOME1,"Let's begin with what you're looking at now - This is called the <b>Desktop</b>, it's where everything starts.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_HOME_MAC,"This isn't like the desktop on a Mac - You can't store files here, it's more like an extended <b>Dock</b>, or the <b>Launchpad</b>.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_HOME_WIN,"This isn't like the Windows Desktop - You can't put files here, only Apps.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_HOME2,"When you install Apps, they'll show up on the grid here, just like your phone.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_DOCS,"You can get to your files by opening <b>Files</b>. You've already got pre-made folders for <b>Documents</b>, <b>Music</b>, <b>Pictures</b>, <b>Videos</b>, and more.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_TRASH_MAC,"You might be wondering where the Trash is - It's in <b>Files</b>. It works the same way - you can recover files you've deleted, or empty it out.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_TRASH_WIN,"You might be wondering where the Recycle Bin is - It's in <b>Files</b>, and it's called the Trash. It works the same way - you can recover files you've deleted, or empty it out.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_STARTMENU1,"You might also be wondering where the <b>Start Menu</b> is. In Endless, this is separated into two parts - To search files and programs, you can type what you're looking for into the <b>Search Bar</b>.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_STARTMENU2,"To get a list of installed programs, you can open the <b>App Center</b> on the <b>Desktop</b> and click the <b>Installed</b> tab at the top.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_SPOTLIGHT1,"If you miss Spotlight, the <b>Search Bar</b> has the same ability to search all your programs and files.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_SPOTLIGHT2,"If you're looking for the <b>Applications folder</b>, you can open the <b>App Center</b> from the <b>Desktop</b>, and click the <b>Installed</b> tab at the top.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_APPS1,"Now that you know the basics of the <b>Desktop</b>, let's talk about <b>Apps</b> and <b>files</b>!",dood,,,
TOURTEST_APPS2,<b>Apps</b> are how you run programs on Endless OS - we use a system called <b>Flatpak</b> that lets you download and install everything from a central location.,dood,,,
TOURTEST_APPS_NET,"Because you're connected to the internet, you can use the <b>App Center</b> to install new apps. ",dood,,,
TOURTEST_APPS_NONET,"You can't install any new apps if you're not connected to the internet, but you can still use the <b>App Center</b> to check what's already here for you to use.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_OPENWRITER,"Let's run an <b>App</b> right now - Find <b>LibreOffice Writer</b> on the <b>Desktop</b>, and click on it to launch it.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_TYPE,Let's type some text. You can type whatever you want!,dood,,,
TOURTEST_TYPE_MOVEBOX,"For the next few steps, we'll need to use controls in the upper-right of the screen, where this text box is. To move this text box, move your cursor just above the first sentence in this text box, and click the little arrow that shows up. That moves this box to the bottom of the screen.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_FILE,"Next, move your cursor into the upper-left part of the screen and click on the <b>File</b> menu.
Then, move your cursor down the menu to <b>Save</b>, and click that.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_SAVEDIALOG,"A new window will pop up. Type whatever you like in the <b>Name</b> space at the top, then click the blue <b>Save</b> button, or press <b>Enter</b> on your keyboard. Don't worry about where you saved your file, yet - we'll get to that soon.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_CLOSE,"Now, let's close <b>LibreOffice Writer</b> by clicking the <b>X</b> in the upper right-hand corner of the <b>LibreOffice Writer</b> window. ",dood,,,
TOURTEST_CLOSE_WIN,Closing a program works the same way in Endless OS and Windows - closing the window closes the program.,dood,,,
TOURTEST_CLOSE_MAC,"On a Mac, if you close a window, the program stays running. Here, on Endless OS, if you close the window, it closes the entire program.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_APPUSED,Great job! You successfully used an App!,dood,,,
TOURTEST_FILES,"OK, now let's find that file you just saved.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_OPENFILES,"Find <b>Files</b> on the <b>Desktop</b>, and <b>click</b> to open it.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_GOTODOCS,"Now we can see all your files! You might remember that when we saved our file in <b>LibreOffice Writer</b>, it went to a folder called <b>Documents</b>. 
You can go into <b>Documents</b> by finding it in the main part of the window and <b>double-clicking</b> it, or by looking on the left side of the window, and <b>clicking</b> on it in the sidebar.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_THEREITIS,"And now that we're inside <b>Documents</b>, look, there's your file!",dood,,,
TOURTEST_FINDBYNAME1,"There's also another way to find that file. First, close the <b>Documents</b> window by clicking the <b>X</b> in the upper-right corner. ",dood,,,
TOURTEST_FINDBYNAME2,Let's pretend you saved a file but didn't remember anything other than part of the name you used. Is there a way to find that file?,dood,,,
TOURTEST_USESEARCH,"Yes, there is! This is where the <b>Search Bar</b> comes in handy. Type your file name in the <b>Search Bar</b>.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_RESULTS,"Hopefully, you'll see just one entry in the results - that's your file! You might see more than one, but you can usually use the location below the name to figure out if it's the one you're looking for.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_OPENAGAIN,"You can click your file in the results list to open it, and now you can edit it again!",dood,,,
TOURTEST_SEARCHLOTS,"You can search more than just files with the <b>Search Bar</b>, too. It can search the <b>Encyclopedia</b> App, and if you're connected to the internet, it can do a Google search for you as well.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_SETTINGS1,"Now, even though Endless OS is set up to work great by default, it can help to know just a little about its inner workings. Let me show you the <b>Settings</b> window!",dood,,,
TOURTEST_SETTINGS2,"The <b>Settings</b> window is how you control all the more detailed parts of Endless OS. Normally, you won't need to use this, but it might be useful in the future, just in case!",dood,,,
TOURTEST_SETTINGS_TRAYICONS,Look in the bottom right corner of your screen - Do you see the icons to the left of the date and time? These icons are shortcuts for important information about your computer.,dood,,,
TOURTEST_SETTINGS_MOVEWIN,"Also, if this text box is still in the bottom-right of the screen, you probably want to move it again - Just use the little arrow right on top of the first sentence, like last time!",dood,,,
TOURTEST_SETTINGS_HASNET,"The icon on the left, the fan-shaped one, shows the strength of your connection to a Wi-Fi network - it's like the ""bars"" on your phone.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_SETTINGS_NONET,"The left-most icon might look like a fan with a little X on it, or an airplane - either way, it means you're not connected to a Wi-Fi network.
(The airplane means ""airplane mode"" - all wireless connections turned off.)",dood,,,
TOURTEST_SETTINGS_TRAY_VOL,"The icon that looks like a little speaker gives you an idea of how loud your volume is. If you see a little X on it, that means your speakers or headphones are muted!",dood,,,
TOURTEST_SETTINGS_LAP_BATT,"You'll also see a little icon that looks like a battery, and I think you can guess what that one means.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_SETTINGS_TRAY_INFO,You can click on any of these icons to get more detailed information about them.,dood,,,
TOURTEST_SETTINGS8,"On the far right, in the corner, is a <b>circle</b> that has some letters in it - they're based off the name you typed in back when you set up Endless OS.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_SETTINGS9,"<b>Click</b> the <b>circle</b>, and a menu will pop up. Then. <b>click</b> the entry in the menu named <b>Settings</b>.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_SETTINGS10,"On the left side of the <b>Settings</b> window is a scrolling list of all the different things you can change - I know there are a lot, but you'll usually only need a few of them.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_SETTINGS11,"Some of the ones you might be interested in are visible already: <b>Wi-Fi</b>, <b>Background</b>, and <b>Power</b>.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_SETTINGS12,"<b>Wi-Fi</b> controls your network connection, useful if you're trying to connect to a specific network, or trying to turn it off to save battery.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_SETTINGS13,"<b>Background</b> lets you set your desktop image to whatever you want. Change it, if you like!",dood,,,
TOURTEST_SETTINGS14,<b>Power</b> lets you change when your computer goes to sleep.,dood,,,
TOURTEST_SETTINGS_LAP_PWR,"Because you have a laptop, you can have your power settings change depending on whether your computer is plugged in or not. Very handy!",dood,,,
TOURTEST_SETTINGS15,"Take a look at more of the settings if you want, but you shouldn't have to change anything! Endless OS is set up to work correctly right out of the box.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_ENDING1,"Congratulations! I know that was a lot, thanks for staying all the way to the end!",dood,,,
TOURTEST_ENDING2,You now should know how to use Endless OS for most basic tasks!,dood,,,
TOURTEST_ENDING3,"Explore all the apps that are already installed, and check out what you can do with them. Here are some examples...",dood,,,
TOURTEST_ENDING4,"<b>LibreOffice</b> is your go-to for anything that you might want to do with text, slideshows, spreadsheets, or diagrams. It's your replacement for Microsoft Office.",dood,,,
TOURTEST_ENDING5,"If you want to learn something, like geography, history, math, and other useful skills, check out <b>Kolibri</b> and the <b>Encyclopedia</b>!",dood,,,
TOURTEST_ENDING6,<b>GIMP</b> and <b>Krita</b> will let you do some Photoshop-quality art to impress all your friends.,dood,,,
TOURTEST_ENDING7,"And, of course, if you want to learn to code, create 3d art, or just learn more about Endless OS, you can try the Hack <b>Clubhouse</b>!",dood,,,
TOURTEST_ENDING8,I hope you have fun with Endless OS - See you around!,dood,,,
