P5JSINTRO1_QUEST_NAME,A Taste of Processing - Learning P5JS,,,,
P5JSINTRO1_QUEST_SUBTITLE,What you'll do,,,,
P5JSINTRO1_QUEST_DESCRIPTION,Take your first steps in coding with P5JS! (Part 1),,,,
P5JSINTRO1_1,"Hey <b>{{user_name}}</b>, I've got something <b>super</b> cool for you! I've been learning a new programming language for making interactive art - I think it's right up your alley!",riley,,,
P5JSINTRO1_2,"It's called <b>p5.js</b> - The ""js"" part comes from <b>JavaScript</b> - you've probably heard of it before, it runs on a ton of websites.",riley,,,
P5JSINTRO1_3,"<b>p5.js</b> has a live online editor we can use - If it doesn't open automatically, use this link: <u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4"">https://editor.p5js.org/</span></u>",riley,,,
P5JSINTRO1_4,"Here's what I've figured out so far: The code is on the left, and the preview is on the right. To run the code, click the play button. Let's try that right now.",riley,,,
P5JSINTRO1_5,"There you go! Not very interesting, but there isn't much there. Let's take a look at the code and see if we can spice it up a bit!",riley,,,
P5JSINTRO1_6,"OK, it looks like there are 2 different parts here - one called <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">setup()</span></tt> and the other called <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">draw()</span></tt>. It looks like <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">setup()</span></tt> creates the place where everything gets drawn, and <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">draw()</span></tt> is where the action happens.",riley,,,
P5JSINTRO1_7,"First, we've got to ditch that boring grey! Change the line with <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">background</span></tt> to read <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">background('green')</span></tt> - Don't forget the quotation marks around the color, it'll cause an error.",riley,,,
P5JSINTRO1_8,"Actually, you know what? Delete those quotation marks and hit 'Play', let's see what an error looks like.",riley,,,
P5JSINTRO1_9,"I got so many errors when I first started, good thing they tell you what line the problem is on! This one is saying ""not a valid color representation,"" on line 6.",riley,,,
P5JSINTRO1_10,"To fix it, we need to enclose <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">green</span></tt> in quotes. So, <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">'green'</span></tt>. Now press 'Play' again.",riley,,,
P5JSINTRO1_11,"Yay, much better. Just like with other web languages, you can also use a <b>hex color</b> like <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">#76EECF</span></tt> or <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">#FFAA00</span></tt> instead of a named color. Give it a shot! You can get more info on hex colors at  <u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4"">https://htmlcolorcodes.com/</span></u>",riley,,,
P5JSINTRO1_12,"Now, you should have code that reads <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">background('#76EECF')</span></tt> (or whatever color you decided on).  If you click play, you should see it in action!",riley,,,
P5JSINTRO1_13,"By the way, if you get tired of clicking play every time, you can click the <b>Auto-refresh</b> checkbox and it will refresh for you as you edit!",riley,,,
P5JSINTRO1_14,"Okay, so we've got a background - now comes the real fun! Let's draw a shape on that background - how about a circle?",riley,,,
P5JSINTRO1_15,"Let's add a new line of code to the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">draw()</span></tt> function. Make sure to add this new line after <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">background(...)</span></tt>, but before the ending <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">}</span></tt>, so that the program knows it's a part of <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">draw()</span></tt>",riley,,,
P5JSINTRO1_16,"Type <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">circle(100,200,50);</span></tt> to draw a circle 100 pixels to the right, 200 pixels down, and 50 pixels in diameter. Don't forget the semicolon ( <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">;</span></tt> ), which lets the program know you've finished a line of code.",riley,,,
P5JSINTRO1_17,"Try playing around with the numbers in the parentheses to see if you can make your circle bigger or move it right, left, up, and down. ",riley,,,
P5JSINTRO1_18,"If you typed a number bigger than 400, your circle probably went off the screen. Remember how in the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">setup()</span></tt> function it says the canvas is 400 x 400?",riley,,,
P5JSINTRO1_19,"Let's make our canvas bigger! Try changing the X and Y values (those two numbers) in the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">createCanvas()</span></tt> function.",riley,,,
P5JSINTRO1_20,"I used <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">createCanvas(600,600)</span></tt>, BTW. Not too big, but bigger than what we started with. ",riley,,,
P5JSINTRO1_21,"Nice, with that new canvas size, your bigger circle should show up now! I gotta run, but there's a ton more stuff to show you in <b>p5.js</b>!",riley,,,
P5JSINTRO1_22,"Next time, we'll add color to our circle, and make it move around the screen to follow the mouse. Catch you later!",riley,,,
