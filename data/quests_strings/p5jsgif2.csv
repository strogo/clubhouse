P5JSGIF2_QUEST_DESCRIPTION,"Now that you're loading images, let's get them moving and shaking!",,,,
P5JSGIF2_1,"Hi <b>{{user_name}}</b>, welcome back!",daemon,,,
P5JSGIF2_2,"First things first - let's get back to the p5.js code editor. You can load your previous sketch (if you saved it at <u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4"">http://editor.p5js.org</span></u> ), or get back to where we left off: <u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4"">https://editor.p5js.org/madetohack/sketches/pYObWwFD</span></u>",daemon,,,
P5JSGIF2_3,"Last time, we learned how to display an animated gif from the internet, and after today, you'll be able to play and pause it!",daemon,,,
P5JSGIF2_4,"If you look up at the top, in the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">preload()</span></tt> <b>function</b> that we wrote last time, we assigned names to your GIFs. We already use those names to load the GIFs, but we can also do things to GIFs while the code is running.",daemon,,,
P5JSGIF2_5,"For example, we could play and pause the GIFs in response to something you do. Maybe… a mouse click? Let’s try that!",daemon,,,
P5JSGIF2_6,"To react to pressing the mouse button, we need to add another <b>function</b>. After the final curly brace ( } ) for <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">draw()</span></tt>, make a new line and type the following: <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">function mousePressed() {</span></tt> (press <b>Enter</b> twice for 2 new lines) <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">}</span></tt>",daemon,,,
P5JSGIF2_7,"That’s the skeleton of the <b>function</b> done, now let’s fill it out. Between those 2 curly braces ( {} ), type <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">gif1.pause();</span></tt> I think you can guess what that does!",daemon,,,
P5JSGIF2_8,"OK, let’s run the code! Click the mouse button, and…",daemon,,,
P5JSGIF2_9,"Hmm. It’s not starting up after it pauses. I think I know why, though.",daemon,,,
P5JSGIF2_10,"See, we just told <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">gif1</span></tt> to <b>pause</b>. We never told it to start up again! For that, we need <b>another function</b>. You might even say our sketch is getting quite.. functional… now :D",daemon,,,
P5JSGIF2_11,"Our new function can go below <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">mousePressed()</span></tt> - so, on the line below the final curly brace ( } ), type <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">function mouseReleased() {</span></tt> (press <b>Enter</b> twice for 2 new lines) <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">}</span></tt>",daemon,,,
P5JSGIF2_12,"To fill out this function, you can add <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">gif1.play();</span></tt> on the empty line between the curly braces ( {} ). Now you can run your code again!",daemon,,,
P5JSGIF2_13,"Much better, now the GIF plays and pauses when you press and release the mouse button.",daemon,,,
P5JSGIF2_14,Congrats! You’ve got control of the GIF now – Are you ready to move on to part 3 and <b>fill the canvas</b>? I think so! See you there!,daemon,,,
