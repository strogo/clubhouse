P5JSVARINTRO1_QUEST_SUBTITLE,What you'll do,,,,
P5JSVARINTRO1_QUEST_DESCRIPTION,"In the first part of this activity, you'll learn how to use variables to make P5JS even easier!",,,,
P5JSVARINTRO1_1,"Hey, <b>{{user_name}}</b>! Today, I want to show you something cool I just learned!",daemon3,,,
P5JSVARINTRO1_2,"Let's start up the online editor for <b>p5.js</b> - If it doesn't open automatically, click this link: <u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4"">https://editor.p5js.org/</span></u>",daemon3,,,
P5JSVARINTRO1_3,"Before we can dive in, we need to do a little setup work for our canvas. Let's add a square, and make it follow your mouse!",daemon3,,,
P5JSVARINTRO1_4,"To make the square, make a blank line inside the curly braces ( <b>{}</b> ) for <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">draw()</span></tt>, after the line that says <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">background(220)</span></tt>. On that new line, type: <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">rect(mouseX, mouseY, 20, 20);</span></tt> Now, if you press the <b>Play</b> button, you'll see a white box following your mouse!",daemon3,,,
P5JSVARINTRO1_5,"You might be wondering why the rectangle is following your mouse... It's because <b>mouseX</b> and <b>mouseY</b> are built-in names for the vertical (top-to-bottom) and horizontal (side-to-side) position of your mouse cursor! They're words that represent special information in <b>p5.js</b>. Let's use some more of them!
",daemon3,,,
P5JSVARINTRO1_6,"We'll use some more code to give the shape some color. Start a new line right above <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">rect(...</span></tt>, and type <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">fill('blue');</span></tt>. When you press the <b>Play</b> button, the square will be blue.",daemon3,,,
P5JSVARINTRO1_7,"<tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">blue</span></tt> is like <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">mouseX</span></tt> - it's a word that represents special information. In this case, it's a specifc color. What if we wanted to make our own color, though? We'll have to make a special name for it, and that's where <b>variables</b> come in!",daemon3,,,
P5JSVARINTRO1_8,"Let's create our <b>variable</b> right at the beginning, above <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">setup()</span></tt>, on line 1. Go to line 1 and type <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">x = 'blue'</span></tt>. This tells the program that when you say <b>x</b>, you actually mean <b>blue</b>.",daemon3,,,
P5JSVARINTRO1_9,"Now that we've created our new <b>variable</b>, let's use it. Go to the line that says <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">fill('blue');</span></tt>, delete <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">'blue'</span></tt>, and type <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">x</span></tt> in its place. Before you press <b>Play</b>, what do you expect to happen? Check and see if you're right!",daemon3,,,
P5JSVARINTRO1_10,"The square is still blue! Cool, huh? <b>Variables</b> can point to text, numbers, or even more complicated kinds of information! In this case, we have a  <b>variable</b> pointing to some text - <b>blue</b>.",daemon3,,,
P5JSVARINTRO1_11,"So far, so good. Let's keep using <b>variables</b>, and do some more cool things with them! Our square has a black outline, so let's use <b>variables</b> to change that.",daemon3,,,
P5JSVARINTRO1_12,"To change the square's outline, we'll use <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">stroke()</span></tt>. Make a new line above the line with <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">fill(x);</span></tt>, and on that line, type <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">stroke(x);</span></tt>. If <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">stroke()</span></tt> controls the outline color, and we're giving it <b>x</b>, what do you expect to happen? Press <b>Play</b> and find out!",daemon3,,,
P5JSVARINTRO1_13,"The square is now <b>all</b> blue, even the outermost part! Great work! For our next trick, let's make the stroke a different color. Any ideas on how to do that?",daemon3,,,
P5JSVARINTRO1_14,"Let's do it with another <b>variable</b>! Make a new line underneath <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">x = 'blue'</span></tt> and type <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">y = 'orange'</span></tt>.",daemon3,,,
P5JSVARINTRO1_15,"We also need to tell the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">stroke()</span></tt> to use the new variable - so change <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">stroke(x);</span></tt> to <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">stroke(y);</span></tt>, and press <b>Play</b>!
",daemon3,,,
P5JSVARINTRO1_16,"Now the outside of our square is orange! As you can see, <b>variables</b> can be super helpful. You can use them as many times as you like - imagine how much typing you could save!",daemon3,,,
P5JSVARINTRO1_17,"If you're logged in to the <b>p5.js</b> online editor, now would be a great time to <b>save</b> your work - You don't want to lose everything you did if you accidentally close this tab.",daemon3,,,
P5JSVARINTRO1_18,"Now that we have the basics of <b>variables</b> down, next time I'll show you how to create random colors using <b>variables</b>! See you then!",daemon3,,,
