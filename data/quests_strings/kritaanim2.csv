KRITAANIM2_QUEST_DESCRIPTION,"Learn to use Layers to make an animation with a background, and learn to customize your animation workspace some more!",,,,
KRITAANIM2_1,Hey there! Are you ready to tackle the next level in animation? ,daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM2_2,"I'm going to show you some tricks that professional animators use to make their animations look great! First, let me open Krita. Remember, if you ever want use it on your own, you can find it on the Desktop, or use the search bar there to find it!",daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM2_3,"Let's start a <b>New File</b>, and we're going to customize it a little bit, like last time. After you click <b>New File</b>, select <b>Custom Document</b>.",daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM2_4,"Let's start out with a square movie - it won't be too hard to work with, and it'll look good even on small screens. Make the width <b>800</b> and the height also <b>800</b>.",daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM2_5,"We need a few more changes before you can click <b>Create</b> - Look for the tab named <b>Content</b>, near the top. It's next to the <b>Dimensions</b> tab that you are currently on. Click on the <b>Content</b> tab.",daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM2_6,"In the <b>Content</b> tab, you can choose how many <b>layers</b> you want to start out with. You can always add or delete more later, but it's nice to have them at the beginning. Set it to <b>2 layers</b>.",daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM2_7,"In the next box, you can adjust the <b>Background Color</b>. Click on it and choose a nice sky color.",daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM2_8,"You can also add a description for your project if you want, but that's not necessary. Now click <b>Create</b> to start your next masterpiece!",daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM2_9,"First, let's add some detail to the background. We have a lovely sky, but let's make some land in front of it. Select <b>Background</b> in the Layer list. You should see a  lock icon next to the name. This means the layer is <b>locked</b> and you can't make changes to it. No drawing, no erasing. Try it and see!",daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM2_10,Click the lock to unlokc the layer. Now you're ready to draw a landscape!,daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM2_11,"Your movie background could be anything, but for this one let's make a simple landscape with some grass and trees. First, we need to add the base colors of our land, so choose a nice green or brown, depending on how grassy or dry you want the land to be.",daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM2_12,"Once you have a good color, use the <b>Freehand Brush Tool</b> (paintbrush icon, next to a diagonal line icon). Then look up at the top toolbar and set the <b>Size</b> to something big - <b>50px</b> or so.",daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM2_13,"Now draw a few stripes stretching all the way across the bottom, coloring up to where you think the horizon should be. The horizon is usually halfway down the canvas or a little lower. This will be the ground!",daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM2_14,"Now we're ready to add grass and trees! You can use any Brush you like for these, but I like to use the Texture collection of Brushes. In the <b>Brush Selector Docker</b>, find the dropdown menu and choose <b>Textures</b>. These brushes will stamp an image, or even many images, instead of drawing a line.",daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM2_15,"You can see a preview of them in the <b>Brush Selector</b>, but they can be a bit small...so let's change that! Did you know you can change the size and layout of the Dockers? Look for a short line of grey dots near the borders of a Docker, then click and drag to adjust its size!",daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM2_16,"You should be able to find those little grey dots on every border for every Docker. Try adjusting different ones. You can also add and remove Dockers, using the <b>Settings</b> menu.",daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM2_17,"Did you find a size and arrangement that works? Can you find the tools you need easily? If not, make any adjustments you need. You're customizing your workspace, just like any professional animator!",daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM2_18,"Now choose a Texture brush, select a color, and try it out! Don't forget you can change the Size slider, and don't be afraid to try lots of brushes! You can always Undo with the Edit menu or ctrl+z. Find your favorites!",daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM2_19,"When your background has some grass, and maybe a few trees, we'll paint a road along the bottom of the picture. To do this, take a ""normal"" brush from the 'Ink' collection (Remember the dropdown? Select 'Ink'!). Select the color black, choose a large Size, and draw a thick line on the bottom edge of your picture. If you like, maybe add some yellow lines. Lookin' good!",daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM2_20,"Are you ready to start drawing the animation? You can always add to the Background later. When you use Layers for each new thing, it's easy to come back and edit one thing at a time.",daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM2_21,"If you don't already have the Dockers for anmations set up from the last activity, go to <b>Settings</b> → <b>Dockers</b> → <b>Timeline</b>, then <b>Settings</b> → <b>Dockers</b> → <b>Animation</b>.",daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM2_22,"Now, remember, we need to create our blank frame before we do any animating. Click the button above the onion icon. When the mouse hovers over it, you'll see it's labeled ""Add Blank Frame.""",daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM2_23,"Next we're going to add a car to this animation! Click on ""Layer 1"" and rename it <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Car</span></tt> or anything else that makes sense to you. Remember, you'll double-click on the title in the Layer list to rename.",daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM2_24,Now you're ready to draw a car on this transparent layer! Anything we draw will show up on top of the Background.,daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM2_25,"Now, select the ""Car"" Layer and use any Brushes or Tools you like to make a car. It can be simple or complex - but I'll tell you a quick way to do it!",daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM2_26,"The simplest way I know to draw a car is to use the Rectangle Tool, and put blocks together in a car shape. Look for a square icon, next to a diagonal line. Make sure the <b>Brush Size</b> is 30px or smaller, then click and drag to make rectangles in the color of your choice. Put a big one in the middle, then add little ones on the left and right for the trunk and hood.",daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM2_27,"You can fill the empty parts with the <b>Fill Tool</b> (it looks like a paint bucket spilling out paint), and cover any weird-looking lines with the <b>Freehand Brush</b> Tool (paintbrush icon, next to diagonal line).",daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM2_28,"To make the wheels, set <b>Brush Size</b> to about 200px and set the color to grey, then dot two circles for the wheels.",daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM2_29,"Wow, you're doing great. You've already learned so much, and your creation is looking good! Take a minute to appreciate the work you've put into your background and your car. Now you've got all the pieces in place for a great animation!",daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM2_30,"All right, let's put that car at the edge of the <b>frame</b>. If you didn't draw it at the edge of the <b>frame</b>, or even if it's not on the road, you don't have to worry! First, select the ""Car"" Layer.",daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM2_31,"Now select the <b>Move</b> Tool. The icon looks like four arrows joined in the middle. Look near the middle of the toolbar. Once you have this Tool selected, you can click and drag your car to move it! Try to make it look like the car is just coming into the scene you drew.",daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM2_32,"Next find your <b>frame</b> in the Timeline and right-click on it. Then select ""Copy to Clipboard."" This saves a copy of your <b>frame</b> that we can paste in to the next frame spot.",daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM2_33,"Now, advance to <b>frame</b> 2. You can use the right arrow key or select <b>frame</b> 2 with your mouse. Either way, right-click on <b>frame</b> 2 and select ""Paste from Clipboard."" This will ""paste"" a copy of your first <b>frame</b> into the spot for <b>frame</b> 2.",daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM2_34,"Since we want the car to look like it's moving, we need to adjust the car's position. Click on the Move Tool, the icon with four arrows joined in the middle. You could click and drag your car again, but we're going to use a keyboard shortcut! Use <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Shift + ➔</span></tt> to move the entire frame to the right a bit! Do this twice.",daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM2_35,"Next, right-click on <b>frame</b> 2 and choose ""Copy to Clipboard."" Right-click on <b>frame</b> 3 and choose ""Paste from Clipboard."" Use <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Shift + ➔</span></tt> twice to move the entire frame to the right. Keep repeating this process to make new <b>frames</b> until the car has traveled across the road. Save often!",daemon2,,,
KRITAANIM2_36,"Remember to set the <b>End Frame</b> of your animation in the <b>Animation Docker</b>, then you're ready to save your work! Good job! Remember me when you're famous, ok? And in the meantime, see what other cool backgrounds you can make. I'm stoked to see your next movie!",daemon2,,,
