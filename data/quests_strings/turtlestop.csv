TURTLESTOP_QUEST_NAME,Turtling Up: Meeting the Turtle!,,,,
TURTLESTOP_QUEST_SUBTITLE,What you'll do,,,,
TURTLESTOP_QUEST_DESCRIPTION,Riley has a new friend she'd like you to meet - The Turtle! He's the best friend to learn programming with!,,,,
TURTLESTOP_1,"Hey <b>{{user_name}}</b>! Everyone learns differently, so we're going to learn programming in a different way today. I want to introduce you to the Turtle!",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_2,"Check your desktop for <b>TurtleBlocks</b>, and open it.",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_3,"OK! This program is how we're going to interact with the Turtle. The Turtle is little software ""creature"" that you can give orders to. Using the blocks in this program, you can tell the Turtle how to move. It'll leave trails behind it, which you can use to draw shapes and experiment with programming! Yeah, that's right - giving orders to the Turtle is a kind of programming!",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_4,"TurtleBlocks might have a lot of buttons, but don't worry, it's pretty simple. The top bar of buttons is mostly used for switching to different groups of commands that you can use to tell the turtle to do things. To use a command, you click the button for the group you want, drag a command into the blue area, and connect it to other commands to make it work.",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_5,"The buttons on the top bar after the Trash Can are for general TurtleBlocks commands. The one that looks a little like a puzzle piece is <b>Hide</b>, which lets you hide or show the button bar and command groups. <b>Clear</b> looks a little like an eraser and lets you erase everything the turtle has done so far. Finally, you have the rabbit and snail buttons - <b>Fast Run</b> and <b>Slow Run</b>. They both tell the turtle to start following the instructions you gave it, but <b>Slow Run</b> will make it easier to see what's going on.",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_6,"Let's start with something simple. We'll just tell the turtle to move, turn, and move again.",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_7,"Click the button with an image of a Turtle in the upper left to open the ""Turtle"" command group. From there, drag out 4 instructions: 2 forwards, and 2 lefts. Once you have them out on the field, drag them into the 'jaws' of the <b>Start block</b> so that they're in the order <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">forward, left, forward, left</span></tt>.",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_8,You can leave all the numbers as they are - now click the Snail button and get the turtle moving!,riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_9,"Cool, huh? The turtle starts looking for instructions at the beginning of the 'jaws' of the <b>Start block</b>, and then marches down the list until it gets to the end. In this case, you told it to go forward, then left, then forward, then left again. All the directions were from the turtle's point of view, so it ended up facing the bottom of the screen after the second left.",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_10,"Let's try changing the details of those commands - the turtle doesn't always have to turn 90 degrees left, after all!",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_11,"Double-click the purple boxes in the commands and change them to 200, 45, 50, 45 - The turtle will now move farther and turn less sharply.",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_12,Click the Snail button again and see how the turtle responds to your changes.,riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_13,You can try changing the order of the instructions if you like - see how it changes the turtle's behavior!,riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_14,"Let's use the turtle to draw a triangle. We'll need a total of 3 <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">forward</span></tt> instructions, but we'll only need 2 <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">left</span></tt> instructions. With those limits, can you think of how to make the turtle draw a triangle?",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_15,"If you already tried it, you've seen that it's more complex than you thought! Remember, even though the sum of all angles of a triangle equals 180 degrees, the turtle can't just turn by that amount. Think about it like you're following the outer wall of an area.",,,,
TURTLESTOP_16,"So, easiest way to make a triangle here is to have your turns be 120 degrees. <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">180 - 120 = 60</span></tt>, and <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">60 * 3 = 180</span></tt>, the sum of all the angles in a triangle! Also, all your sides will need to be the same length - if a triangle's angles are all the same, the sides need to be the same too!",,,,
TURTLESTOP_17,"Great triangle! If you drew an equilateral triangle, try drawing a right triangle! You can also play around with the commands to draw other shapes.",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_18,Drawing a shape is fun - but it's kind of a pain to drag all those instructions around and change the values for all of them. What if there was a way to do it faster?,riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_19,"Click the ""circling arrows"" button at the top of the screen to open another command group, and drag the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">repeat</span></tt> block into the blue area.",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_20,"Now, drag a <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">forward</span></tt> block and a <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">left</span></tt> block into the 'jaws' of the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">repeat</span></tt> block.",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_21,"Remove all the other blocks from the 'jaws' of the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Start</span></tt> block, and drag the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">repeat</span></tt> block in. You can just leave the other blocks hanging around - if they aren't connected to <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">start</span></tt>, the turtle can't see them!",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_22,"Set your <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">forward</span></tt> block's number to <b>75</b>, and your <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">left</span></tt> block's number to <b>45</b> by double-clicking the purple boxes on each block.",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_23,"Double-click the purple box on the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">repeat</span></tt> node and set the number to 8.",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_24,"Now, press the <b>Snail</b> button and away we go!",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_25,"Cool, huh? That's an octagon!",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_26,"But, you know, I can think of something even cooler than an octagon's 8 fantastic sides and 8 awesome angles...",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_27,We're going to use every tool we have in TurtleBlocks to create something cool! ^_^,riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_28,"OK, first, let's get make sure our shape is filled in - Switch to the 'pencil' command group, and grab the 'start fill' and 'end fill' blocks. Put <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">start fill</span></tt> before the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">repeat</span></tt> block, and put <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">end fill</span></tt> after the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">repeat</span></tt> block.",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_29,"Whenever you're trying to do a specific thing, it's always important to test your programs! Let's test our filled-in shape by clicking the snail button!",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_30,Nice. If you don't see what we're doing.... think about why we might have left the turtle colored red!,riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_31,"This next set of instructions is pretty specific - I figured them out ahead of time and it took me a little while to get the right values, so check your work carefully!",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_32,"We're gonna need a shopping list-worth of new nodes to make this work, so let's get going.",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_33,"From the ""Turtle"" command group, we need a <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">left</span></tt> block, a <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">right</span></tt> block, and 2 <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">forward</span></tt> blocks.",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_34,"From the ""Pencil"" command group we need the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">pen up</span></tt>, <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">pen down</span></tt>, and <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">set color</span></tt> blocks.",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_35,"From the ""Colors"" command group we need the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">white</span></tt> block.",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_36,"From the ""Notebook"" command group we need the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">set scale</span></tt>, and <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">show</span></tt> blocks.",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_37,"Now that you've dragged all those nodes out, let's get them all into the correct order.",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_38,"Below <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">end fill</span></tt>, add <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">pen up</span></tt> - This will stop the turtle from drawing any lines while we do some precise movement!",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_39,"After <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">pen up</span></tt>, add <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">left</span></tt> with a value of <b>90</b>, <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">forward</span></tt> with a value of <b>178</b>, <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">right</span></tt> with a value of <b>90</b>, and then <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">forward</span></tt> with a value of <b>28</b>.",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_40,"Next, it's <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Pen down</span></tt>, then <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">set color</span></tt>, and drag our <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">white</span></tt> block into the little slot on the right side of <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">set color</span></tt>.",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_41,"Then <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">set scale</span></tt> with a value of <b>100</b>, and finally, <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">show</span></tt> with a value of <b>STOP</b>!",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_42,"Now it's time to test everything! If you want to clean out the screen first, you can press the Eraser button, but otherwise, press the Snail button and watch our turtle go! Watch as the instructions change color while the program runs. If anything goes wrong, you'll see where it happens!",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_43,"If everything is right, you should have a stop sign... which, of course, is an octagon!",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_44,"Try experimenting with all the instructions we used to do this - you should have a pretty good idea of what they do if you watched the turtle step through them. As a challenge, try making a Stop sign that's twice as big as this one! Or maybe, if you're feeling confident, try making a Yield sign!",riley,,,
